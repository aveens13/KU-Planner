Directions on using git branching in this project

- It is good to make a branch of their own in which they will be working so there will not be errors while pushing and pullling and codes can be managed throughly.
- Command: <text>git branch <branch_name> and git checkout <branch_name> or single line command is git checkout -b <branch_name> </text>
